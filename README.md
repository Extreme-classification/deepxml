# DeepXML

Code for _DeepXML: A Deep Extreme Multi-Label Learning Framework Applied to Short Text Documents_

## Requirements

---

* Pyxclib
* NumPy
* PyTorch
* Numba
* Scikit-learn

---

## Architectures and algorithms

DeepXML supports multiple feature architectures such as Bag-of-embedding/Astec, RNN, CNN etc. The code uses a json file to construct the feature architecture. Features could be computed using following encoders:

* Bag-of-embedding/Astec: As used in the DeepXML paper [1].
* RNN: RNN based sequential models. Support for RNN, GRU, and LSTM.
* XML-CNN: CNN architecture as proposed in the XML-CNN paper [4].

---

## Best Practices for features creation

---

* Adding sub-words on top of unigrams to the vocabulary can help in training more accurate embeddings and classifiers.

---

## Example use cases

---

### A single learner with DeepXML framework

The DeepXML framework can be utilized as follows. A json file is used to specify architecture and other arguments.

```bash
./run_main.sh 0 DeepXML EURLex-4K 0 108
```

### An ensemble of multiple learners with DeepXML framework

An ensemble can be trained as follows. A json file is used to specify architecture and other arguments.

```bash
./run_main.sh 0 DeepXML EURLex-4K 0 108,666,786
```

* gpu_id: Run the program on this GPU.

* framework
  - DeepXML: Divides the XML problems in 4 modules as proposed in the paper.
  - DeepXML-OVA: Train the method in 1-vs-all fashion [4][5], i.e., loss is computed for each label in each iteration.
  - DeepXML-ANNS: Train the method using a label shortlist. Support is available for a fixed graph or periodic training of the ANNS graph.

* dataset
  - Name of the dataset.
  - Expected files in work_dir/data/<dataset>
    - train.txt
    - test.txt

* version
  - different runs could be managed by version and seed.
  - models and results are stored with this argument.

* seed
  - seed value as used by numpy and PyTorch.
  - an ensemble is learned if multiple comma separated values are passed.
```
